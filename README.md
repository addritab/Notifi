# **NOTIFI**
</div>

Notifi is an ultra-minimal focus tracker, inspired by Notion’s simplicity but stripped down for daily productivity. Instead of managing long-term projects, Notifi keeps your day on track with just three core features: a streamlined checklist, an integrated lofi player, and a built-in Pomodoro timer. Its design is intentionally spare, eliminating distractions to help you maintain deep focus on today’s most important tasks.
